NatureHelm is a platform that provides biodiversity intelligence for corporations, suppliers and other users to help them successfully navigate the complex world of biodiversity risks and opportunities. Learn more [here](https://www.naturehelm.com/).

I interned at NatureHelm from late July to the end of October 2024, where I contributed to the integration of multiple data analytics tools into the platform. Below, you can find a brief overview of my work in the form of a video pitch and poster.
