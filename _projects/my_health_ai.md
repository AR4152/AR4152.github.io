Most health applications rely on centralized servers to store and process sensitive data, raising concerns about privacy, data ownership, and security. This project presents a decentralized health assistant that leverages Solid Pods for personal data storage and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to user health queries. Built as a cross-platform Flutter application and integrated with the MLHub package for LLM related tasks, the system ensures that all data remains under the user's control - offering privacy-preserving, personalized health support without relying on cloud-based infrastructure.
