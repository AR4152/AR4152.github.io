During the COVID-19 pandemic, I collaborated with a team to develop a machine learning algorithm that utilizes computed tomography (CT) scans (in PNG format) to detect and segment lung lesions caused by the coronavirus or other infections. This model is integrated into a web-based interface, allowing users to easily upload and analyze test files for lesion identification.


## Development Process

The following video provides an overview of our development process, along with a tutorial on how to use the website interface:
