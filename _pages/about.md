Hi there, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a third-year undergraduate research student at the [Australian National University](https://anu.edu.au/), with a keen focus on computer science research. I am also a researcher at the [TIME Lab](https://time.anu.edu.au/) and work as a Software Intern at [NatureHelm](https://naturehelm.com).

As a CS researcher, Iâ€™m broadly interested in all aspects of machine learning, and particularly in computer vision, image/video analysis, deep learning and action recognition. Currently, I'm exploring â€˜motion-centricâ€™ topics under the supervision of [Dr. Lei Wang](https://leiwangr.github.io/). Additionally, Iâ€™m starting to serve as a Reviewer for conferences, beginning with [ICASSP](https://2025.ieeeicassp.org/).

As a software developer, I am proficient in a range of technologies, including Python, Java, SQL, AWS, MS Power Tools, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. I have experience working on various [projects](/projects/), with strong expertise in backend development and data science, and a solid understanding of most technologies. I have also developed workflows using automation tools like Power Automate, implementing systems such as multi-level purchase approvals with tracking UI and site publication notifications.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing sports (mostly running and ultimate frisbee), watching F1 and cricket, traveling, and going on hikes with friends and family. I also enjoy gazing at the blue sky during the day.

<!-- *Curious about my username, AR4152? With â€˜Arjun/ArjunRajâ€™ always taken, I had to come up with a unique set of characters - â€˜Aâ€™ stands for Arjun, and â€˜Râ€™ stands for Raj. 41 is the hexadecimal-value of A, and 52 is the hexadecimal-value of R.* -->
